ScreenLight - Neon Glass (Complete)

hey everyone - here’s the complete revision to my first muOS theme; it’s neon based. the theme is 640x480 (rg35xxsp). hdmi capable (1280x720). sub menu has been streamlined (smaller icons). 13 variations.

ScreenLight - Neon Glass (Original)
ScreenLight - Neon Glass (Color Splat)
ScreenLight - Neon Glass (Light)
ScreenLight - Neon Glass (Dark)
ScreenLight - Neon Glass (Dark - Purple)
ScreenLight - Neon Glass (Dark - Red)
ScreenLight - Neon Glass (Dark - Yellow)
ScreenLight - Neon Glass (Yellow)
ScreenLight - Neon Glass (Green)

just download - then drag to the theme folder in muOS

also have created a few hundred custom collection, system, & media artwork for the menu navigation. still compiling but once done i’ll definitely upload them. again, any issues at all just let me know and i’ll check it out.

if anyone downloads and enjoys (and also loves modernized video game trailers and conceptual takes)
